        Hockey is a team sport played on a field or indoor arena, where two teams compete to maneuver a small ball or puck into the opponent's goal using a hockey stick. It is played in various forms including field hockey and ice hockey.
        
        Field Hockey: Field hockey is played on a grass or artificial turf field. Each team typically consists of eleven players, including a goalkeeper. Players use curved sticks to pass, dribble, and shoot the ball. The objective is to score goals by hitting the ball into the opposing team's net. Field hockey matches are typically played in two halves, each lasting 35 to 40 minutes.
        
        Ice Hockey: Ice hockey is played on an ice rink. Each team usually has six players on the ice, including a goaltender. Players use hockey sticks to control a puck and score goals by shooting it into the opponent's net. Ice hockey is known for its fast-paced, physical nature, with players skating at high speeds and engaging in body checks to gain possession of the puck. Ice hockey matches are also divided into periods, typically three periods of 20 minutes each.
        
        Both forms of hockey have international competitions and domestic leagues, with the most prestigious being the Olympic Games for field hockey and the National Hockey League (NHL) for ice hockey. Hockey is popular in many countries around the world, including Canada, the United States, India, the Netherlands, and various European nations. It requires speed, skill, and teamwork, making it an exciting and dynamic sport to watch and play.
